# School_Projects
Projects I have done while in school.

Database Prog - Final Project
  The purpose of this project was to create a database of the student's choosing and satisfy all criteria listed by the professor.
  For this project, I chose create a database that would link scrapyards across the nation and allow the public to search and find 
  parts that they need. We used Oracle and PL/SQL for this project. We had to incorporate functions, triggers, programs, exceptions,
  and complex queries to meet the criteria for the project.

JAVA 1 - Final Project
  For this project, we were instructed to create a movie database that had to have certain elements such as:
    Main and sub menus.
    Admin and users with seperate menus and permissions.
    As an admin, the ability to add, delete, alter movies in the database.
    As a user, the ability to add ratings and comments on each movie.
    All should be able to search and find movies.
    Use Java to make connections to a MySQL database where the movies and users are stored.
    
Web Prog - Final Project
  In this project, we were given a basic HTML website with all formatting and wireframe already setup. From there, we converted
  the entire website to a PHP design. We were given a list of possible modifications that we could do from there to enhance the 
  webpage that was given to us. If we did everything on the list, we would get extra points after a certain point. I opted to do
  as many of these modifications as possible. Some of them were small while others required lots of work.
    I created a blog post page where the admin could upload blogs about the beach resort. Each post is Titled, dated, allows
    admin to upload a blog image, and shows the most recent post in order.
    I created a News page where an admin user can upload news about the beach resort.
    I also added an admin functionality page where the admin could view and perform various duties within the website.
    The contact form was made to post to the database and store the data within the specified fields.
    JQuery was added to validate the form prior to submission.
    Finally, I added a registration page for users. This allows them to login (which sets the login cookie which allows them
    to perform various functions on the webpage).
    All usernames and passwords were stored in the database and the passwords were encrypted.
